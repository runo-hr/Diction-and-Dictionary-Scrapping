# Diction and Dictionary Scrapping.

## Problem Statement
Write an application which, when given a web page will download the text on it and output a sorted list of the unique words on the page, with counts of the occurrences.
### Extensions
Consider extending the application to work with a dictionary, or configurable word list, so one can e.g. find the non-English words on the page. Or perhaps provide a way to compare two (or more pages) in terms of words found in both and only in one or the other?
